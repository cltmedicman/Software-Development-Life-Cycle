How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are very effective in hwlping to determine the user needs in a program design and showing me how to best design
the software to incorporate their needs into the design and output of the program.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I think agile is the best way to approach developing any program. If you don't have a basis to work from, that is a product
backlog that is prioritized to know what needs to be accomplished first, then you are just coding with no real goal in sight.
Without these goals to keep you on track, then the program will flounder and the output will be very ineffecient and ineffective.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member takes criticism as a tool to better themselves and their work. They alow give constructive criticism to help better
their teammates and the end product. They don't give criticism to belittle or point out shortcomings. A good team member is always
willing to help and always does their part to contribute to the overall success of the product and the team.
